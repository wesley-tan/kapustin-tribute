          <h2>About Kapustin</h2>
          <p>Nikolai Girshevich Kapustin, born on November 22, 1937, in Ukraine, was a distinguished composer and pianist who seamlessly blended jazz idioms with classical music forms. Initially trained at the Moscow Conservatory where he honed his skills in classical piano and composition, Kapustin grew to develop a profound love for jazz, drawing influence from the likes of Art Tatum and Oscar Peterson. His work is celebrated for its sophisticated fusion of classical structure with jazz-style improvisation, contributing a unique voice to both genres.</p>
